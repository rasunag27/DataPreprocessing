# DataPreprocessing

* The data in the real world are generally inconsitent, incomplete and noisy. Feeding this data directly into an ML model will not work. It has to be processed such that the datasets are complete and efficient.
* Data preprocessing is a crucial step before inserting into an ML model.
* In the code, a simple data is used and data preprocessing is done with following steps.
  * Data loading
  * Library import
  * Dealing with missing data
  * Encoding categorical data
  * Splitting the dataset into training and testing data
  * Feature Scaling
* Lets go through the process ony-by-one
